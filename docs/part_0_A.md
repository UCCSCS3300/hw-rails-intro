## Part 0 (A): Preparation: get RottenPotatoes running locally

Before you start, make sure your local workspace is synched with your class private git account. From the homework directory, do a `git pull origin master` and confirm there are no errors. 

The actual RottenPotatoes starter app you will use is in another public repo: [UCCSCS3300/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro](https://github.com/UCCSCS3300/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro). Clone that repo to your homework directory and remove the .git directory inside of the rottenpotatoes-rails-intro folder.

```sh
$ cd /root/environment/homework
$ git clone https://github.com/UCCSCS3300/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro.git
$ rm -rf /root/environment/homework/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro/.git
```
Whenever you start working on a Rails project, the first thing you should do is to run Bundler, to make sure all the app's gems are installed.  Switch to the app's root directory (in this case `rottenpotatoes-rails-intro`) and run `bundle install --without production` (you only need to specify `--without production` the first time, as this setting will be remembered on future runs of Bundler for this project).

Finally, get the local database created:

```sh
$ rake db:migrate
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> How does Rails decide where and how to create the development database?  (Hint: check the <code>db</code> and <code>config</code> subdirectories)</summary>
  <p><blockquote>The <code>rake db:migrate</code> command creates a local development database (following the specifications in <code>config/database.yml</code>) and runs the migrations in <code>db/migrate</code> to create the app's schema.  It also creates/updates the file <code>db/schema.rb</code> to reflect the latest database schema.  <strong>Note: it's important to keep this file under version control.</strong> </blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> What tables got created by the migrations?</summary>
  <p><blockquote>The <code>movies</code> table itself and the rails-internal <code>schema_migrations</code> table that records which migrations have been run.</blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

Now insert "seed data" into the database--initial data items that the app needs to run:

```sh
$ rake db:seed
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> What seed data was inserted and where was it specified? (Hint: <code>rake -T db:seed</code> explains the seed task; <code>rake -T</code> explains other available Rake tasks)</summary>
  <p><blockquote>A set of movie data which is specified in <code>db/seeds.rb</code></blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

At this point you should be able to run the app locally (`rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8080`) and navigate to `http://URL:8080/movies` in your browser.  
**For those using Docker Toolbox, go to `http://192.168.99.100:3000/movies` as in prior examples**  
**If you are using Codenvy, use the play button and navigate to the link generated within codenvy**.
Note: If you stop the server by hitting control-C, you will no longer be able to visit the RottenPotatoes site. Start the server again by repeating the last command. 

Welcome to RottenPotatoes!

Lastly, back the working framework up in github. 
```sh
cd /root/environment/homework
git add rottenpotatoes-rails-intro/
git status //Make sure all the new files are tracked AND on stage for being committed!!
git commit -m â€œInitial HW2"
git push origin master
```
